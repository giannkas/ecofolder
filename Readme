This program implements the Esparza/R�mer/Vogler unfolding algorithm for
low-level Petri nets (see [ERV02]). It is designed to be compatible with
the tools in the PEP project [Ste01] and with the Model-Checking Kit [SSE03]
- its input is a low level Petri net in PEP's .ll_net format, and its output
is the resulting unfolding in the .mci format also used in the PEP tools.

This tool represents an overhaul of Stefan R�mer's ERVunfold tool (which,
in turn, was an enhancement of the EVunfold tool from PEP). It is much
smaller and does not have the vast set of options that ERVunfold has;
in exchange, this tool is usually somewhat faster than ERVunfold. The
default set of options is to use the Esparza/R�mer/Vogler unfolding and
not to compute global configurations, i.e. running

	ecofolder some.ll_net

should be equivalent to

	ERVunfold some.ll_net -m=some.mci -c -n=1 -@@

Calling Ecofolder without any argument yields a usage summary.
Currently, there are just two options:

-m <some.filename>
	Normally, if the input net is some.ll_net, then the resulting
	unfolding will be written to some.mci. This option allows the
	result to be written to some other file.

-d <some.number>
	Unfolding is performed up to the given depth, i.e. the generated
	prefix contains all events whose local configuration size does
	not exceed some.number. No cutoff events will be generated.

-T <some_transition_name>
	The unfolding process will abort as soon as an event is found
	which is related to the named transition.

-i	The program outputs verbose information about the discovered
	events and conditions and allows the user to choose among the
	potential extensions. (Cutoffs are added immediately without
	asking because adding them at any other time would not change
	the result.)

As of version 1.0.5, the distribution contains an additional utility
called mci2dot. The input of this tool is an .mci file (as produced
by ecofolder), and its output can be processed by the dot tool from the
Graphviz package (http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/) in
order to visualise the unfolding. Calling

	mci2dot some.mci

will cause mci2dot to read the file some.mci and print the results
to standard output.

History:

Version 1.0.0 (16.03.2004)
	First public release.
Version 1.0.1 (17.03.2004)
	Changed the ordering of events in the resulting .mci file to maintain
		compatibility with unfolding-based deadlock checkers.
	Changed the syntax of the -T switch (see above).
Version 1.0.2 (21.09.2004)
	Changes to the -T switch: Fixed faulty .mci generation; unfolding now
		aborts earlier when transition is found.
Version 1.0.3 (02.02.2005)
	Fixed a bug in the -T switch (crashed when transitions had no name).
Version 1.0.4 (06.06.2005)
	Added -d switch.
Version 1.0.5 (22.03.2006)
	Fixed another bug in -T (thanks to Sarah Hickmott for the report).
	Added -i switch and added mci2dot to the distribution.
Version 1.0.6 (23.03.2006)
	Fixed a bug in marking.c (thanks to Sylvie Thiebaux for the report).
